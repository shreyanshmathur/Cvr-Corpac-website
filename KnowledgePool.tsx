      content: `GST is a comprehensive value-added tax system that replaced multiple indirect taxes in India. It operates on the principle of 'One Nation, One Tax, One Market' to create a unified national market.

Core Concepts:
• Input Tax: Tax paid on purchases/inputs
• Output Tax: Tax collected on sales/supplies
• Input Tax Credit: Set-off of input tax against output tax
• Place of Supply: Determines applicable tax (CGST+SGST or IGST)

Legal Framework:
• Constitutional Amendment (101st) enabling GST
• Four Acts: CGST, SGST, UTGST, and IGST
• Rules and notifications for implementation
• GST Council for policy decisions

Value-Added Taxation:
• Tax levied at each stage of supply chain
• Credit of taxes paid at previous stages
• Eliminates cascading effect of taxes
• Final consumer bears the tax burden

The GST system ensures transparency, reduces compliance burden, and promotes economic growth through simplified tax structure and seamless credit flow.`
